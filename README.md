## Synopsis

This chrome extension project features self-written chrome extensions. Ideas are based on personal preferences and experience.
Future plan is to feature extensions which will be based on public inputs, suggestions and ideas.

## Products

<b>MuteXor</b> - A browser action chrome extension which allows users to "PAUSE" Youtube videos that are playing in other tabs(non-active tabs). This tool is useful when the user opens series of tabs of Youtube videos and does not want to go through each tab to pause the videos. User may remain at his/hers current video and pause all other Youtube videos playing in other tabs just by clicking the <b>MuteXor</b> action button located at the side of the url/address bar.</br>
Since the <b>Tab Muting Feature</b> in Chrome is undergoing an experimental phase, I believe <b>MuteXor</b> will come in handy!

## Motivation

The purpose of this self-initiated project is to contribute to the Google Chrome Extensions community and to further hone my coding skills and broaden my technical knowledge.

## Installation

1) Download the <b>&#42;.crx</b> file.<br />
2) Launch <b>Google Chrome</b>.<br />
3) Go to <b>Window > Extensions</b> (or) Click the <b>three-lined button(a.k.a)hamburger button</b> in the top right-hand corner of the browser and go to <b>Tools > Extensions</b>.<br />
4) Check the box next to <b>Developer mode</b> at the top of the page.<br />
5) Locate the downloaded <b>&#42;.crx</b> file on your computer, drag and drop it onto the Extensions page.<br />
6) You will be prompted with series of access permissions requests.<br />
7) Successful installation of the extension is verifiable if a new icon appears at the right side of the url/address bar of your chrome browser.
